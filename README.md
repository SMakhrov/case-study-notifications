# Optimizing the Notification System for Task Notifications

---

## 1. Identifying Key Challenges

### Challenges in the Current Notification System

1. **Irrelevant Notifications:**
   - Notifications fail to align with TPs' skills, regions, or preferences, leading to frustration and low engagement.

2. **Notification Overload:**
   - TPs are overwhelmed by too many notifications, reducing their ability to identify critical tasks.

3. **Task Competition:**
   - Popular tasks receive disproportionate attention, reducing individual chances for TPs.

4. **Timing and Relevance:**
   - Notifications may be sent at suboptimal times or for outdated tasks.

5. **Scalability:**
   - The system must handle thousands of TPs and tasks daily while remaining efficient and timely.

## 2. Problem Definition

### Primary Problem to Address
**Improving the relevance and prioritization of notifications.**

### Why Focus on This Problem?
- Irrelevant notifications directly reduce engagement and task success rates.
- Addressing prioritization ensures better user satisfaction and increased task completion.

### Impact
1. **For TPs:**
   - Enhanced user experience with relevant notifications.
   - Increased opportunities to secure tasks aligned with preferences.

2. **For Business Goals:**
   - Higher task completion rates.
   - Improved customer satisfaction and reduced TP churn.

## 3. Exploration and Discovery

### Data Required
1. **TP Interaction Logs:**
   - Clicks, accepts, ignores, and unsubscribes for each notification.
2. **Task Metadata:**
   - Categories, geographies, publish times, competition levels.
3. **TP Profiles:**
   - Skills, regions, historical preferences.

### Methods to Validate the Problem
1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
   - Analyze patterns in TP engagement, such as CTR and unsubscribe rates.
   - Identify task categories or regions with low engagement.

2. **A/B Testing:**
   - Test notification relevance strategies and measure changes in engagement.

3. **Behavioral Segmentation:**
   - Group TPs with similar interaction behaviors to tailor notifications.

4. **Feedback Surveys:**
   - Gather insights from TPs about their satisfaction with notifications.

## 4. Solution Ideation

### Overview
The solution integrates three components to address the problem:
1. **ALS for Filtering:** Filters tasks to identify those most relevant to each TP.
2. **LightGBM for Engagement Prediction:** Estimates the likelihood of engagement for each task.
3. **LambdaRank for Prioritization:** Ranks tasks to ensure optimal notification order.

### Why These Models?

1. **ALS (Alternating Least Squares):**
   - Handles sparse interaction data.
   - Identifies hidden preferences and task similarities.
   - Reduces computational overhead by filtering irrelevant tasks.

2. **LightGBM:**
   - Handles diverse features (categorical, numerical, interaction-based).
   - Predicts engagement probability using task, TP, and interaction features.

3. **LambdaRank:**
   - Optimizes ranking metrics like NDCG.
   - Balances engagement potential and competition.

### Detailed Breakdown

#### Step 1: Filtering with Collaborative Filtering (ALS)

**Goal:** Reduce irrelevant tasks, leaving a manageable subset for each TP.

**Input Data**
- **Interaction Matrix (TP Ã— Task):**
  - Rows: TPs.
  - Columns: Tasks.
  - Values:
    - 1: TP positively interacted (clicked or accepted).
    - 0: TP ignored the task.
    - -1: TP explicitly rejected the task.

**Example Interaction Matrix:**

|      | Task_1 | Task_2 | Task_3 | Task_4 |
|------|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| TP_1 | 1      | 0      | 1      | -1     |
| TP_2 | 0      | 1      | -1     | 1      |
| TP_3 | -1     | 0      | 1      | 0      |

**Output**
- Top-N tasks for each TP ranked by relevance score (`ALS_Score`).

**Example Output:**

| TP_ID  | Task_ID | ALS_Score |
|--------|---------|-----------|
| 101    | 5001    | 0.92      |
| 101    | 5003    | 0.85      |

#### Step 2: Predicting Engagement with LightGBM

**Goal:** Predict the likelihood of engagement for tasks identified by ALS.

**Input Data**
1. **Features:**
   - **Task Metadata:** Category, publish time, urgency.
   - **TP Features:** Historical CTR for similar tasks.
   - **Interaction Features:** `ALS_Score`, competition score.

**Example Input Table:**

| TP_ID  | Task_ID | ALS_Score | Category_Painting | Publish_Hour | Competition_Score | CTR_Painting |
|--------|---------|-----------|-------------------|--------------|-------------------|--------------|
| 101    | 5001    | 0.92      | 1                 | 14           | 0.4               | 0.65         |

**Output**
- Predicted probability of engagement (`Predicted_Probability`).

**Example Output:**

| TP_ID  | Task_ID | Predicted_Probability |
|--------|---------|-----------------------|
| 101    | 5001    | 0.85                  |
| 101    | 5003    | 0.78                  |

---

#### Step 3: Ranking with LambdaRank

**Goal:** Rank tasks for notifications by balancing engagement potential and competition.

**Input Data**
- **Engagement Probabilities:** Predicted by LightGBM.
- **Competition Scores:** Competition_Score = Interested_Specialists / Max_Specialists

**Output**
- Final scores for task ranking: Final_Score = Predicted_Probability * (1 - Competition_Score)

**Example Output:**

| TP_ID  | Task_ID | Final_Score |
|--------|---------|-------------|
| 101    | 5003    | 0.62        |
| 101    | 5001    | 0.51        |

#### Risks and Potential Challenges

1. **Cold Start Problem:**
   - **Risk:** New TPs or tasks lack sufficient interaction history.
   - **Mitigation:** Use heuristics based on geographical and categorical matching.

2. **Data Drift:**
   - **Risk:** Changes in user behavior or task characteristics affect model performance.

   - **Mitigation:** Use distributed systems (e.g., AWS SageMaker for ALS, Kubernetes for deployment).

4. **Notification Fatigue:**
   - **Risk:** Excessive notifications lead to disengagement and unsubscribes.
   - **Mitigation:** Enforce limits on notification volume per TP and prioritize high-relevance tasks.

5. **Overfitting:**
   - **Risk:** Models might overfit to historical data and fail to generalize.
   - **Mitigation:** Use cross-validation and ensure diverse training datasets.
